# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Data folder

The data folder contains two subfolders called “training_data”(where all the provided data are put) and the “extra_data”(where the independent data will be put). 

Since the size of the raw images is too large to be uploaded in GitHub, we didn’t include them here, but they are provided by the instructors. We only include the “gist_features.csv” for both provided data and the independent testing data(will be uploaded after class), the “sift_features.csv” for both provided data and the independent testing data(will be uploaded after class), and the “labels.csv” for the 2000 given data. 

When user clone the GitHub to their local computer, For the two subfolders, both of them should contain the “raw_images”, ”sift_features” folders and the lables.csv, gist_features.csv.
