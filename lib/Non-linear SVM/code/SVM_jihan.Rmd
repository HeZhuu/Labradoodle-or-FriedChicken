```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Step 0: Install packages and specify directories:

In this step, we check whether the needed packages are correctly installed and then set the path for training and testing data. 
```{r}
packages.used=c("e1071","EBImage","ggplot2")
packages.needed=setdiff(packages.used, intersect(installed.packages()[,1], packages.used))
if(length(packages.needed)>0){
  install.packages(packages.needed, dependencies = TRUE)
}
library(EBImage)
library(e1071)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
# here replace it with your own path or manually set it in RStudio to where this rmd file is located.
#setwd("./spr2017-proj3-group-1/")
```

Provide directories for raw images.Instead of putting them separately in different files, we generate random numbers to split the data.

Note, to ensure the results are reproducible, set.seed() is used whenever randomization is needed. However, you can change the option if you like.
```{r}
##here is where all the given 2000 pictures are put
experiment_dir <- "../data/training_data/raw_images/"  
##here is where all the independent testing set are put (it will be given in class)
#testing_dir <- "../data/extra_data/raw_images/" 
```


Step 1: set up controls for evaluation experiments.

In this chunk,we have a set of controls for the evaluation experiments.
* (T/F) use set.seed before randomization to get reproducible results.
* (T/F) cross-validation on the training set
* (number) K, the number of CV folds
* (T/F) use our created new features to build the model
* (T/F) run evaluation on an independent test set
```{r}
set_seed=FALSE         #use set.seed() whenever randomization needed
run.cv=TRUE            # run cross-validation on the training set
K <- 5                 # number of CV folds
train_proportion=0.60  # Porportion of the data that used for training the model
new.feature.train =TRUE      #process features for gievn training set
new.feature.test=TRUE       # process features for independent testing set
run.test=TRUE        # run evaluation on an independent test set
```

Step 2: import training images class labels:

```{r}
y<- read.table("../data/training_data/labels.csv", header=T)
y<-as.factor(t(y))
n<-length(y)
```

Step 3: Preparation for Training the model:
Step 3.1:Extract new features:
```{r}
source("../lib/extract_feature.R")

tm_feature_train <- NA
if(new.feature.train){
  tm_feature_train<- system.time(X <- extract_feature(img_dir=experiment_dir,                                                 data_name="Newfeature_train", export=T))
  #X is 2000*1024
  } else {
  X <-t(read.csv("../data/training_data/sift_features/sift_features.csv",header=T))
  #X is 2000*5000  
  }



tm_feature_indetest<-NA
if(new.feature.test){
  tm_feature_indetest<- system.time(X_inde_test<- extract_feature(testing_dir,                                                 data_name="Newfeature_inde_test", export=T))
  
  save(X_inde_test,file="../output/Newfeature_inde_test.RData")
}

```

Step 3.2:Random split the data to training and testing set:
```{r}
if(set_seed){
  set.seed(0)
  Index<-sample(n,round(train_proportion*n,1),replace = F)
} else{
  Index<-sample(n,round(train_proportion*n,1),replace = F)
}
#n is the No. of all provided data
Train.x<- data.matrix(X[Index,])
Train.y<-y[Index]
Test.x<-data.matrix(X[-Index,])
Test.y<-y[-Index]
```

Step 4: Train a classification model with training images.
```{r}
source("../lib/Train_svm.R")
```

Step 4.1 : Model selection with cross-validation:
Do model selection by choosing among different values of training model parameters.

For the ¡°RBF¡± SVM, there are 2 major parameters that need to be determined: One is the ¡°Cost¡±: which is the parameter for the soft margin cost function, which controls the influence of each individual support vector; this process involves trading error penalty for stability. And another is Gamma, which represent the bandwidth for the kernel functions.

Due to the fact that we want to pick a ¡°good¡± combination rather than an individual value of parameter, the tuning process for the methods requires longer time than other methods that only involve one parameter. 

Cosidering this, we provide 2 options: Option_1: is trying less combinations, and for Option_2, we try more combinations of ¡°Cost¡± and ¡°Gamma¡±, but it may take long time to perform the Cross-Validation. (maybe 5-6 hours)
```{r}
Option_1<-TRUE  ##If you choose FALSE,Option 2 will be used
```

```{r}
if (run.cv){
  ##Set values for the parameters:
  if (Option_1){
    candidates<-list(cost=c(.1,0.5,1,1.5,2,3),gamma=c(.001,0.005,0.08,.01,0.5))
    #candidates<-list(cost=c(.1,0.5,1,1.5,3,5,7),gamma=c(0.5,1,5,10,20,30))
  } else {
    candidates<-list(cost=c(.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.1,1.3),gamma=c(.001,0.003,0.005,0.007,.01,0.03))
  }
  
  ##Tune the model:
  tc<-tune.control(cross = K)  #set K-folds based on user-selection
  svm_tune <- tune(svm, train.x=Train.x, train.y=Train.y,
                   kernel="radial",scale=F,ranges=candidates,tunecontrol = tc)
  
  
  ##Get the performacne for each model:
  performace_svm<-svm_tune$performances
  
  ##Save resilts:
  save(performace_svm, file="../output/performance_cv.RData")
}
```

Visualize cross-validation results:
```{r}
if (run.cv){
  ##Plot 3D version:
  plot(svm_tune ,type='persp', main ="CV error vs different value of margin & bandwidth parameter")
  
  ##Plot 2D version(cost as x-axis):
  performace_svm$gamma2<-as.factor(performace_svm$gamma) 
  ggplot(data=performace_svm)+ geom_line(aes(x=cost,y=error,linetype=gamma2,col=gamma2))
  
  ##Plot 2D version(gamma as x-axis):
  performace_svm$cost2<-as.factor(performace_svm$cost) 
  ggplot(data=performace_svm)+ geom_line(aes(x=gamma,y=error,linetype=cost2,col=cost2))
}
```

Print the best parameters and train the model:
```{r}
tm_train=NA
if (run.cv){
  ##Get the parameters with the best results:
  best_cost<-performace_svm$cost[which.min(performace_svm$error)]
  best_gamma<-performace_svm$gamma[which.min(performace_svm$error)]

  ##Train the model:
  tm_train <- system.time(fit_train <- train_svm (Train.x,Train.y,
                                                 gamma=best_gamma,cost = best_cost))
} else {
  tm_train <- system.time(fit_train <- train_svm (Train.x,Train.y))
}

##Save the model:
save(fit_train, file="../output/fit_train.RData")
```

Step 5: Model Evaluation:

Step 5.1: Get the training and testing error based on the given 2000 data:
```{r}
##Get the training accuracy:
pre_train<-predict(fit_train,Train.x)
mean(pre_train==Train.y)

##Get the test accuracy:
pre_test<-predict(fit_train,Test.x)
mean(pre_test==Test.y)
```

Step 5: Make prediction for new testing set:
Here, we valuate the model with the completely holdout testing data.
```{r}
tm_test=NA
if(run.test){
load(file = ("../output/Newfeature_inde_test.RData"))
tm_test <- system.time(pred_newtest <- predict(fit_train,X_inde_test))
save(pred_newtest, file="../output/pred_newtest.RData")
}

#y2<- read.table("../data/extra_data/labels.csv", header=T)
#y2<-as.factor(t(y22))

#mean(pred_test==y22)
#pred_test
```

Step 6: Summarize Running Time
```{r}
if (run.test & new.feature.test){
  cat("Time for constructing training features=", tm_feature_train[1], "s \n")
  cat("Time for training model=", tm_train[1], "s \n")
  } else{
    cat("Time for constructing training features=", tm_feature_train[1], "s \n")
    cat("Time for training model=", tm_train[1], "s \n")  
    cat("Time for constructing testing features=", tm_feature_test[1], "s \n")
    cat("Time for making prediction=", tm_test[1], "s \n")
}
```
